Back in 2013, [Retro Report](http://www.retroreport.org/) joined the Slow Journalism fold. Distributed by _The New York Times_, the organisation makes 10-12 minute mini-documentaries that revisit big news stories—mostly from the 1980s and 1990s—and investigate what has happened since.

In May 2013, Retro Report wondered how much truth there was in the widespread claims made in the 1980s that the US social services system would soon be overwhelmed by a generation of [crack babies](http://www.retroreport.org/video/crack-babies-a-tale-from-the-drug-wars/) (answer: not much). Last Sunday, they released [their 53rd mini-documentary](http://www.retroreport.org/video/a-right-to-die/), which takes the media hype surrounding Dr Jack Kevorkian, aka Dr Death, as a starting point to discuss the ethical debate on assisted suicide today.
