_DR. SANJAY GUPTA:_ _We thought we had measles essentially licked._

**NARRATION:** **So why is this disease coming back from the brink of extinction?**

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (NBC, 8-27-13):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_DR. LAURA POPPER: Some people are deciding they're afraid of vaccines._

**NARRATION: And that fear's putting the nation's health at risk. How did we get to this point where personal belief is more powerful than science?**

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (FOX NEWS, FOX & FRIENDS):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

ANNOUNCER: _The greatest medical news in history! Dr. Jonas Salk discovers a vaccine that promises to wipe out childhood's crippling and killing enemy -- polio!_

**NARRATION: In the 1950s, the Salk vaccine was greeted with open arms.**

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL: __</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

ANNOUNCER: _Civics clubs had immunization parties!_

**NARRATION: Polio, smallpox, diptheria…** **no longer a threat in the** **U.S. because of vaccines. And in 2000, another watershed moment.**

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (NBC): __</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_JANE PAULEY_: _The CDC reports the measles, practically wiped out tonight, in the United States._

**NARRATION:** **But that report proved overly optimistic. Measles are back. More than 600 cases were reported in the U.S.** **and another disease that looked like it was disappearing a generation ago is also making a comeback** **– whooping cough. Unlike measles, its return is in part attributed to the waning effectiveness of its vaccine, but it shows how the spread of a disease can impact the most vulnerable.**

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (CBS, CBS EVENING NEWS, 9-23-10): __</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_KATIE COURIC_: _The risk of whooping cough may sound like something from the past but it__'__s still very real. Today California reported more than 4200 cases. Nine people have died -- all of them infants_.

**NARRATION:** **For San Francisco mother, Mariah Bianchi, those numbers are more than just statistics. When her son was born in August 2005, as a nurse, she realized something was wrong.**

MARIAH BIANCHI: It was just like he was so lethargic. And I knew that there was just something. I'm like, I can't keep him awake. We went to the doctor and she said, 'I want you to go to the hospital.' As soon as he got there, he went into cardiac arrest.

**NARRATION: What she didn't realize was that the immunity from her own whooping cough vaccine had worn off and she'****d infected her newborn, who was too young to be innoculated.**

MARIAH BIANCHI And they started CPR right away, for probably about 45 minutes or so. As a nurse I'm thinking, 'I know what that means.' Your brain is not getting oxygen. Your body is failing." And the surgeon came out, and he said, "his chance of survival is very low." We made the most compassionate decision you could, but we just said, you know, don't-don't do it. Just stop.

**NARRATION:** **Dylan Bianchi died 17 days after he was born. Vulnerable people, like newborns, depend on the immunity of those around them to protect them from dangerous diseases. To keep** **_measles_** **from spreading, for example, about 94% of a community needs to be vaccinated.** **It****'****s called herd immunity. In some areas, that****'****s a concern.**

DR. NELSON BRANCO (PEDIATRICIAN): Here in Marin County, California, you have pockets of people who are not vaccinating their children. There are certain schools and communities where that rate is as high as 50 percent. And what I fear is that we have an epidemic of measles, an outbreak and that we have children that are very ill or that die.

SETH MNOOKIN (ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, M.I.T. GRADUATE PROGRAM IN SCIENCE WRITING): The measles vaccine has been so effective it doesn't seem like something we need to protect our children from. You have this, sort of, fundamental paradox of vaccines, that they've become a victim of their own success.

**NARRATION_:_ Seth Mnookin examines the fear of vaccines in his book "The Panic Virus."**

SETH MNOOKIN: The current vaccine scares and controversies that we're still dealing with today stem from a 1998 paper that appeared in the Lancet, a very respected medical journal published out of the U.K.

**NARRATION: The paper, written by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, claimed there might be a connection between the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and autism_._**

SETH MNOOKIN: In his press conference, Andrew Wakefield stood up and said, "Parents should not give their children the MMR vaccine, period, until we are able to get to the bottom of this."

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (ITN, 1998):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_ANDREW WAKEFIELD: The MMR vaccination in combination that I think it should be suspended in favor of the single vaccines._

SETH MNOOKIN: The notion that you would take a 12 person case study and make claims about a population as a whole is ridiculous. This paper was historically bad.

And what the media in the U.K. did was, they ran with that.

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (ITN, 1998):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_REPORTER:_ I_t's a dilemma_

SETH MNOOKIN: You know, that's a sensational story.

**NARRATION: Follow up studies of hundreds of thousands of children could not find any evidence that the MMR vaccine causes autism. And investigations into Wakefield's original paper revealed he distorted the data and acted unethically.**

SETH MNOOKIN: He lost his medical license, the Lancet paper has been retracted, but he had very effectively positioned himself as a martyr and in some odd way, every piece of evidence that comes out against Wakefield, sort of, solidifies his standing in-in the community that still pays attention to him.

**NARRATION: Another reason fears about vaccine safety persisted is that complicated science proved difficult for public health institutions to communicate. Case in point, their response when concerns were raised over a vaccine preservative called thimerosal, which contains ethyl mercury.**

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (__</u>_<u data-redactor-tag="u">C-SPAN):</u>

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_MAN:_ C_hildren are getting mercury injected into their bodies with vaccines_!

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (CBS, 7-15-05):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_SHARYL ATKISSON: That__'__s right, mercury, a known neuro toxin._

**NARRATION:** **But ethyl mercury in thimerosal is not the same as the toxic methyl mercury, which is found in fish and accumulates in the body. Nevertheless, the public health service and the American academy of pediatrics recommended thimerosal be removed.... And their messaging backfired.**

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (CBS, 5-18-04):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_SHARYL ATKISSON_: _In 1999, health officials denied a link between vaccines and the autism epidemic yet urged vaccine makers to take out the mercury just to be safe._

SETH MNOOKIN: What the American Academy of Pediatrics said, is, "We are recommending this step so we can make safe vaccines even safer." As a parent, if you tell me something's safe, I don't think that's on a sliding scale. I assume that, if you say it's safe, it is safe for my child. It's not safe, safer, safest. There are almost two languages here. There's the language of science, and then there's English. And, in the language of science, you have these signifiers like, to the best of our knowledge, as far as we know…

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (CBS, CBS EVENING NEWS, 5-28-04):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_DR. STEVE COCHI (CDC IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM):_ _Based on the available scientific evidence_…

SETH MNOOKIN: Because you can't say anything with 100%. You can't prove a negative. And so, when scientists speak in their language, and the rest of us translate that into English, it sounds like they're saying something very different than they're saying.

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (CBS, EARLY SHOW, 7-15-05):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_DR. TANJA POPOVIC (CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL): Based on what we know right now, we don't think that there is an association._

_SHARYL ATTKISSON: But that's not saying with 100 percent certainty there isn't one._

_TANJA_ _POPOVIC: That is saying, that based on the evidence we have right now, we don__'__t think there is one._

SETH MNOOKIN: Either because the reporter doesn't understand what's actually going on, or because they're looking to generate a story, they then take that and make it seem as if the scientist is saying, "I think there's a possibility that vaccines do cause autism" when, in fact, that's not it, at all.

BRENDAN NYHAN: News organizations should exercise judgment about what goes out over their air.

**NARRATION: Brendan Nyhan is a professor at Dartmouth College who studies how misinformation spreads, and the role of the media.**

BRENDAN NYHAN: What's particularly important is to think about the overall scientific consensus. Where is the weight of the evidence? And is our reporting reflecting that or not? That's what's often gone astray in the vaccine debate

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (NBC, THE TODAY SHOW, 10-30-08):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_DR. NANCY SNYDERMAN: It's time for everyone to redirect the questions toward finding the cause of autism. It is not however vaccinations_

_MATT LAUER: Controversial subject, Nancy._

_NANCY SNYDERMAN: Not controversial subject!_

_MATT LAUER: Well, controversial for parents who still believe._

_NANCY SNYDERMAN: It is not controversial, Matt, it is time for kids to get their vaccines._

BRENDAN NYHAN: Every day people can't be fact checkers for every story about vaccines. When journalists don't give people the weight of the scientific evidence, they're letting them down.

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL:__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_WOMAN: She got her vaccinations, she ran a low grade fever, she got a little rash, and then she stopped talking._

**NARRATION****: A false sense of balance was also created when scientific evidence was equated with people****'****s personal experiences.**

_SETH MNOOKIN:_Reporting fell into this, on the one hand, on the other hand fallacy, this notion that if you have two sides that are disagreeing, that means that you should present both of them with equal weight.

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (ABC, OPRAH, 9-24-07):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_JENNY MCCARTHY: We vaccinated our baby and something happened._

SETH MNOOKIN: Jenny McCarthy has had more to do with popularizing the notion that vaccines are dangerous than any other single person in the United States.

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (CNN, LARRY KING LIVE, 9-27-07):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

LARRY KING: _We begin of course with Jenny McCarthy, the actress, and entertainment personality. Her son Evan has autism_.

SETH MNOOKIN: She's very smart, she's telegenic.

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (CNN, LARRY KING LIVE, 9-27-07):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_JENNY MCCARTHY: Look at, it's plain and simple. It's bullshit!_

_DR: No, it's not._

_JENNY MCCARTHY: Yes, it is._

_DR: Excuse me._

SETH MNOOKIN: When I look at clips of her, it's a completely unfair fight.

_<u data-redactor-tag="u">ARCHIVAL (ABC, OPRAH, 9-24-07):__</u>_

<u data-redactor-tag="u">

_JENNY MCCARTHY: Oprah: My science is named Evan. He__'__s at home. That__'__s my science_

SETH MNOOKIN: Jenny McCarthy has said many times, and oftentimes very loudly, that her child is her scientific fact. Any scientist or any science reporter who's familiar with how science works would say that, "No, any one person is an anecdote, and the plural of anecdote is not data." You know? It's just a story.

**NARRATION: But stories are powerful. While vaccination rates are high nation-wide… there are some religious and ethnic enclaves and communities where well-educated, upper middle class people live where vaccine hesitancy runs strong.**

SETH MNOOKIN: I was interviewing an epidemiologist and he said, oh yeah, we completely know where we're going to have communities that have issues with vaccine uptake. We take a map and stick a pin wherever there's a Whole Foods and draw a circle around it, that's where we're going to have problems. He was obviously being facetious

**NARRATION: Exasperated health officials are trying to come up with new ways to communicate with the public. Brendan Nyhan conducted a study and watched how hesitant parents reacted when they were shown information from the CDC web site stating there'****s no evidence the MMR vaccine causes autism.**

BRENDAN NYHAN: The good news was, it did cause parents to be less likely to believe in the myth that the MMR vaccine causes autism. The bad news is, however, that it made them less likely to say they would vaccinate a child. Which is precisely the opposite of what we would hope to see. What we found is that telling people the correct information wasn't actually effective.

**NARRATION: That may mean we****'****ve reached the point where public health officials and the media can****'****t even talk about vaccine safety without it backfiring. But fears generated by the latest measles outbreakmay help people understand more clearly the value of vaccines -- and what****'****s at stake.**

Mariah Bianchi: What does it take? How many times do you have to tell people or talk about it? We all have a role in helping each other to protect each other. A vaccine preventable disease should not have killed my son.
