In 1977, the flame retardant TRIS was removed from children's pajamas as a suspected carcinogen, but it continued to be used in a host of other products—including baby cribs, car seats, and furniture.

Since then, scientists have discovered that flame retardants can leach out of products into household dust, collect in our bodies, and pose health risks, especially to developing babies.

But no flame retardant has been banned by the federal government, and there are no specific tests required before a new chemical is put on the market. And with 80,000 untested chemicals out there, that raises a question: how do we know what's safe?
