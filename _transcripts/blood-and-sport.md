**Blood and Sport**

**November 9, 2015**

**__TEASE:__**

November 13, 1982

___ARCHIVAL (ABC NEWS, 11-15-82):___

_ANCHOR: This other story out of Las Vegas tonight._

___ARCHIVAL (ABC NEWS, 11-13-82):___

_DIANE SAWYER: The challenger Kim was fighting champion Ray Mancini._

___ARCHIVAL (CBS SPORTS,11-13-82):___

_REPORTER: For 13 rounds it was what some observers called a war._

KIERAN MULVANEY (AUTHOR AND BOXING ANALYST):Imagine you’ve got a pickup basketball game going on a street corner, a bunch of people are watching. And then on the other corner a fight breaks out. People are going to stop watching the basketball game and they’re going to watch the fight

___ARCHIVAL (11-13-82):___

_ANNOUNCER: A right hand sending Kim to the canvas! It’s all over! Ray Mancini, a 14th round knockout!_

KIERAN MULVANEY: There’s something fundamental and primal about boxing. But as society shifts, there are legitimate questions of, “Well, do we still want to do this?”

___ARCHIVAL (11-13-82):___

_ANNOUNCER: Kim is still down, he’s being taken out on a stretcher evidently. Taking him to a nearby hospital._

KIERAN MULVANEY: It’s that drip, drip, drip, that constant sense that that is what boxing is about. If that becomes the prevailing feeling about football, then the discussion changes.

__ACT I:__

RICK GENTILE (CBS SPORTS, 1982-98): In the old days, you might turn on the TV on a weekend afternoon and three networks would have a boxing match on. In 1982, particularly, there was an NFL strike and, figuring NFL fans are going to want to see action sports, we replaced it with boxing.

___ARCHIVAL (CBS):___

TIM RYAN: Mancini is enjoying being a world champion.

**NARRATION: In May of that year, Ray “Boom Boom” Mancini, the pride of Youngstown, Ohio, had won his first world lightweight championship.**

___ARCHIVAL (CBS SPORTS, 11-13-82)___

RAY MANCINI (FORMER WBA LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION): I worked so hard to get it I’m not about to give it up now.

RICK GENTILE: Ray Mancini was a very, very popular champion. His whole persona was of being just this nice kid from Ohio. The ratings for Mancini fights were great, our highest ratings of any fighter we were doing.

**NARRATION: On November 13, 1982, in a Las Vegas stadium before a live CBS audience, Mancini was set to defend his title against a little-known Korean challenger.**

___ARCHIVAL (CBS SPORTS, 11-13-82):___

_RING ANNOUNCER: Fighting out of Seoul, Korea, weighing 134 and 1/4 pounds. Here is Duk-Koo Kim._

RICK GENTILE: We had never heard of Duk-Koo Kim before that, but we would look at film, videotape, whatever we could get of him fighting and we knew he was a very tough guy. We didn’t want a guy who was going to run. We wanted somebody who would stand there and exchange. And that was Kim’s style.

___ARCHIVAL (CBS SPORTS, (11-13-82):___

_TIM RYAN: And there’s the bell and we are underway…_

RAY MANCINI:Kim built a coffin and he put it next to his bed, and he told his people, “Either Mancini’s going home in that or I’m coming home in that.” He put on his lampshade, “Kill or be killed.” To him it was a live or die situation.

RICK GENTILE: It was a brutal fight. In fact, Kim was the aggressor more than Ray, for most of the fight. But there was never a point where you thought one guy was beating the other guy to the point where a referee should have stepped in.

___ARCHIVAL (CBS SPORTS, 11-13-82):___

_TIM RYAN: Duk-Koo Kim: You may not have heard of him before, you will remember him after today. Win or lose._

RAY MANCINI: I was hitting him with shots, but he was still moving and making me miss, too. He still had the wherewithal to move his body, slip, bob and weave. You can’t stop a fight when a guy has the wherewithal to do that.

It was a great punch. I hit him with the right shot and he went down. We just jumped. It was glorious because it was a great win. Nobody knew the--what was going into it. Nobody knew.

___ARCHIVAL (CBS SPORTS, 11-13-82):___

RAY MANCINI: I planned on a long fight. Everybody didn’t know about that. I saw films, the guy was very impressive. Tough, rough, hungry, determined, those are the worst kind.

RICK GENTILE: The next morning I called and said, “What’s going on?” And he was still in the hospital in bad shape. And then it was pretty much—we all knew what was going to happen. You know, he wasn’t coming out of this.

RAY MANCINI: I was stunned, I was like in a dream world, you know, from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows.

___ARCHIVAL (ABC, 11-14-82):___

DIANE SAWYER: A professional boxer lies near death tonight. He is Duk-Koo Kim, a 23-year-old South Korean lightweight.

___ARCHIVAL (CBS NEWS, 11-17-82):___

DAN RATHER: The boxer’s mother pleading with him to “please wake up” and “open eyes” before she was led from the room, weeping.

RAY MANCINI: When you fight fighters from another country, they’re fighting for more than themselves. They’re fighting for their whole country. They’re carrying the dreams and hopes of their countrymen on their backs. That’s a load to fight. That’s a hard load to fight.

**NARRATION: Kim’s death was far from boxing’s first fatality in the ring. In the early ‘60s, fighters Benny Paret and Davey Moore died in back-to-back years after major fights on national television.**

KIERAN MULVANEY: At that point there was a sense of, “Well, is boxing even really a sport? Then in the mid-70s you have the sense of impropriety that has been an aspect of boxing’s DNA for many decades. And then in ’82 you had Ray Mancini and Duk-Koo Kim.

__ACT II:__

GEORGE LUNDBERG (EDITOR, JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 1982-99): And then, two weeks later I’m watching and there’s this fight with Randall “Tex” Cobb and Larry Holmes.

___ARCHIVAL (ABC, 11-26-82):___

HOWARD COSELL: Just terrible. I wonder if that referee understands that he is constructing an advertisement for the abolition of the very sport that he's a part of?

GEORGE LUNDBERG:Cobb was a punching bag. I mean, his head was just bobbing back and forth, on, and on, and on.

___ARCHIVAL (ABC, 11-26-82):___

HOWARD COSELL: From the point of view of boxing, which is under fire and deservedly so, this fight could not have come at a worse time.

GEORGE LUNDBERG: And I just said to myself, “This is crazy. How can I, as a physician, possibly admire this? Enhance it, support it, and not work against it?”

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 1-14-83):___

_DAN RATHER: Boxing attracts big television audiences. It has drawn the attention of writers from Virgil to Hemingway to Norman Mailer. But today the American Medical Association came out swinging against the sport._

___ARCHIVAL, (ABC 1-14-83):___

_REPORTER: The AMA Journal says that boxing is an obscenity that should not be sanctioned by any civilized society._

___ARCHIVAL (ABC 1-14-83):___

_GEORGE LUNDBERG: The purpose of the boxing match is for one person to injure his or her opponent. Now when one knocks somebody out, one damages the brain, one tears brain cells._

RICK GENTILE: I don’t think fight fans said, “Okay, that’s it. I’m never going to watch another fight,” just as they didn’t say, “Okay, I’m never going to smoke another cigarette,” when they put a warning on the pack. But sponsors started to pull back and say, “You’re asking us for a lot of money, you networks, to pay for your exorbitant rights fees on football and basketball and baseball. And with all the bad publicity boxing is getting, you know what, we just as soon not do it.”

RAY MANCINI: Before the Kim fight, I was being offered all kind of endorsement deals. After that, everything went away, man. It just vanished. I understand that now. I understand now. But at the time I was like, I was a kid. I was heartbroken. I didn’t know why. You know? It just, it all went away.

**NARRATION: For decades, stories of young boxers from blue-collar backgrounds fighting their way to fortune had captivated the public both in real life.**

___ARCHIVAL (NBC, 5-11-84):___

_CHILD BOXER: I do it because I’ll leave, I’ll leave the ghetto._

**NARRATION: ...and on the big screen.**

_Clips from “Rocky”_

**NARRATION: But before long, the medical community began to make inroads in their fight against the sport.**

GEORGE LUNDBERG**:** The American Academy of Pediatrics came out with a formal position that children shouldn’t box. I took a position that, for any parent who put their child into a boxing situation, that should be considered child abuse.

**NARRATION: And on television, beer companies were soon the only marquee advertisers still associated with boxing.**

___ARCHIVAL (BUDWEISER AD, 1979):___

_The WBC championship fight is being brought to you by Budweiser. For all you do, this Bud’s for you._

KIERAN MULVANEY: Sponsors withdraw so network TV doesn’t want to broadcast it. People don’t see as much boxing, so they don’t know as much about it, so sporting media doesn’t write about it as much because they say people don’t watch boxing, they’re not interested in it. And because media isn’t reporting on, people learn about it even less. It becomes this feedback thing and before you know it, suddenly it’s a niche sport.

___ARCHIVAL (CNN, 10-7-96):___

_ANNOUNCER: The legendary Julio Cesar Chavez returns to the ring, Saturday, October 12, on Pay-Per-View!_

R. TODD JEWELL (TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY, CO-AUTHOR, “VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSION IN SPORTING CONTESTS”): There's absolutely an undercurrent in sports spectatorship which is about, they like the intrinsic violence of this. You're going there to live out some sort of spectator fantasy. Somehow MMA over time has, sort of, taken the place of boxing. In the NFL it's almost like a fight every play, and the plays happen over and over, quick, quick, quick, quick. People like that. It keeps their attention.

KIERAN MULVANEY: There was a guy called Bert Sugar, an old boxing historian, and he said to me a while back, “I submit to you that the best American heavyweight right now is Ray Lewis.” Guys who were 200-something pounds, 6’4”, 6’5” were no longer seeing boxing as the opportunity for them. They could go into football and they could earn a lot more money at a lot less risk.

**NARRATION: That perception of football is starting to change.**

__ARCHIVAL (CNN, 5-2-12):__

_JOHN KING: This half-hour NFL great Junior Seau has apparently committed suicide. Sadly, he’s not the first NFL star to take his own life._

__ARCHIVAL (ABC 5-4-12):__

_ANCHOR: Meantime, more players are suing the NFl, claiming the league failed to properly protect them from concussions and brain injuries during their careers._

JONATHAN MAHLER (REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES): Look,at this point, we know how dangerous football is. Anyone who continues to believe that professional football players aren’t potentially shortening their lifespan by playing this game is of living on another planet.

___ARCHIVAL (NBC NEWS, 5-17-15):___

_LESTER HOLT: In a surprise announcement, star 49ers linebacker Chris Borland says he's retiring from the NFL after just one season._

___ARCHIVAL (ABC NEWS, 5-17-15):___

_REPORTER: The San Francisco 49er says he’s walking away from it all today, concerned about brain injury in the future._

CHRIS BORLAND (LINEBACKER, SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS, 2014 SEASON): Around training camp there was an incident, just a mild concussion and it kind of changed the way I viewed the risks of the game. The mounting evidence and these anecdotes of guys who went through hell -- by the end of the year, I had a good idea of what I was going to do. For 99.9 percent of the people in America, football’s just entertainment, and theater. But the guys on the field are real. They’re humans, and so I think it’s important to remember that.

RICK GENTILE: The NFL has a big issue in the concussion, the head injury situation, huge issue. But, there is an entity called the National Football League. There’s a controlling entity, a managing entity. Football has the NFL to solve its problems or to at least try to solve its problems. It has a PR machine to tell the public that we’re working on this. Boxing was controlled by promoters and the networks back in the day. So there was no such thing as boxing. It had no ability to defend itself because there’s no organization. And that might have been one of the biggest problems they had.

**NARRATION: Today, the organization behind football has more money and power than any sport in American history.**

___ARCHIVAL (FOX NEWS SUNDAY, 2-2-14):___

_CHRIS WALLACE: You now make about $10 billion a year in gross revenue. You said that by 2027 you would like to see $25 billion._

_ROGER GOODELL: We don’t want to become complacent._

**NARRATION: Meanwhile, the dark side of the sport is hitting home on local fields across the country.**

__ARCHIVAL (NBC NEWS, 10-2-14):__

REPORTER: Smith is the seventh high school football player to die this season, either during or directly after a game. And we’re only halfway through.

CHRIS BORLAND: I hear from young kids who love football, and want to play football. And they do ask me questions of “Should I play?”

R. TODD JEWELL: If white suburban households stop allowing their kids to play football, is football going to die? And the answer is absolutely not.

JONATHAN MAHLER: There certainly is a double standard. If you support football in the sense that you watch it, and then turn around and don’t allow your child to play it -- The question is kind of like by watching it are you necessarily condoning it? It’s so ingrained in our culture that it does take a kind of real act of-of-of like protest and resistance to-to turn away from it.

**NARRATION: Three decades since the Kim/Mancini fight stoked medical concerns about boxing, football doesn’t appear to be slowing down. More people watched the Super Bowl in 2015 than any show in U.S. television history.**

KIERAN MULVANEY: If somebody were to die during an NFL game being broadcast live. The massive social media response. Would that cause a greater, perhaps long-term response? Or would it mean that everyone went through the cycle of grief and outrage in a couple of days until Kim Kardashian did something else? I don’t know. The concussion issue has been pretty serious and there’s been a lot of conversation about it. And football viewership figures keep going up.
