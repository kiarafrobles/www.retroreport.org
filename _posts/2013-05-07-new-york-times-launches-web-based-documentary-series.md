One of the oldest players in traditional media, the_New York Times_, is embarking on a new project that could help turn the paper into a full-fledged online video network.

This week, the paper quietly launched a new Web-only documentary series - in conjunction with Retro Report - on Boomer, its blog targeting the baby boomer generation. Formed earlier this year, Retro Report is a not-for-profit documentary company that counts former _60 Minutes_ producer Kyra Darnton as its managing editor. Each 10-15-minute documentary will be presented every Monday on the_New York Times_ website, accompanied by an article, until 2014.
