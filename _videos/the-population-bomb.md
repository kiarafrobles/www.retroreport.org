In 1968, the release of Paul Ehrlich's best-selling book _The Population Bomb_ and his multiple appearances on the “Tonight Show" helped spread fears that our planet could not sustain itself. Population concerns were already percolating, and Americans soon flocked to Ehrlich's movement, Zero Population Growth, whose mantra on children was “stop at two."

While many of his forecasts did not come true, they left a legacy that is still with us today. In the end, the story of The Population Bomb sheds a fascinating light on the dangers of prediction and the adaptability of the human race.
