"Tailhook." It was called the worst case of sexual harassment in the U.S. Navy’s history and led to promises of culture change. But 20 years later, how much has really changed?

To answer that, Retro Report looks at what really happened at the 35th Annual Tailhook convention, where investigators later determined that 83 women and 7 men had been sexually assaulted. With interviews with some of those involved – like former Navy lieutenant Paula Coughlin, who stepped into the national spotlight when she said she had been sexually assaulted at Tailhook -- the story provides new context for the current crisis over sexual assault in the military.

The Pentagon recently estimated that 26,000 troops were sexually assaulted last year, an increase from 19,000 in 2010. And yet only 3,374 were reported. Only days before the Pentagon report was released, the officer in charge of the Air Force’s sexual assault prevention programs was arrested and charged with sexual battery.

As The Legacy of Tailhook explores and President Obama aptly noted, "This is not a new phenomenon."
