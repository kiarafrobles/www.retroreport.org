The recount of votes in Florida during the 2000 election focused worldwide attention on the countryâ€™s antiquated and disorganized voting system: chads (hanging, dimpled, pregnant or otherwise), confusing ballots, under-votes and over-votes. A bipartisan consensus soon emerged that the mechanics of voting needed to be improved. But the election also reminded many politicians that a few hundred votes could mean the difference between winning and losing. And, 16 years later, the rules of voting are more controversial - and politicized - than ever.
