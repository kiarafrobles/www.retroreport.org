On the morning of October 8, 1969, just days after the end of a disappointing season for the St. Louis Cardinals, Curt Flood's phone rang.

The voice on the line told Flood he had been traded to Philadelphia, but the veteran center fielder didn't want to go. Baseball players long had no say in where they played, thanks to a court-protected "reserve clause" allowing team owners to perpetually renew their contracts, and Flood wanted control over his life.

Describing himself as a "well-paid slave," Flood invoked the spirit of the civil rights movement, and highlighted demographic tensions still at play between team owners and professional athletes. In basketball, Oscar Robertson, the first black president of the NBA players union, would become the face of the fight for free agency in his sport.

As detailed in this episode of Retro Report, an online news documentary series released in partnership with The New York Times, Flood and Robertson put the power dynamics of America's sports on trial, both in the court of law and of public opinion, and championed a movement that forever changed the game.
