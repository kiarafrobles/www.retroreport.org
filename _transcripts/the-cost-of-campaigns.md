DATE: June 17, 1972

___ARCHIVAL (ABC, 6-19-72):_______

_ANCHOR: Over the weekend, five men were nabbed in the Democratic National Headquarters here in Washington, seemingly preparing to tap or bug the place._

**NARRATION: It was the scandal to end all political scandals… and while it may have started as a burglary, it soon led to a secret money trail...**

_GARRICK UTLEY: Illegal contributions to President Nixon's reelection campaign.._

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 2-27-73):___

_WALTER CRONKITE: The secret $200,000 contribution…_

___ARCHIVAL (NBC 9-18-73):___

_DAVID BRINKLEY: …putting the U.S. government on the block for sale, like a side of beef._

**NARRATION: And a law that was to limit the influence of money in politics forever.**

___ARCHIVAL (NBC, 1-30-76):___

_GARDNER: We’re never, never, never going back to the old corrupt way of doing things._

**NARRATION: But money found its way... back in…**

___ARCHIVAL (CBS 10-21-88):_________

_DAN RATHER: Soft money._

___ARCHIVAL (NBC, 10-21010):_______

_MICHAEL ISSIKOFF: Secret money._

___ARCHIVAL: (CNN 09-18-12):_______

_AVLON: Dark money._

**NARRATION: And 40 years later, there are record amounts of money flowing through the political system… a system some say is less accountable than ever.**

LAWRENCE LESSIG (CO-FOUNDER, MAYDAY PAC): We can do legally everything Nixon had to do illegally.

**__ACT I:__**

___ARCHIVAL (NBC, 8-11-72):_______

_LIONEL HAMPTON (SINGING): Oh, President Nixon, comes marching in..._

**NARRATION: It was 1972\. And President Richard Nixon was on his way to a landslide reelection, backed by one of the most successful fundraising efforts in history.**

___ARCHIVAL (NBC, 8-11-72):_______

_ANCHOR: If it takes money and an organization to elect a president, the Republicans are ready with both._

**NARRATION: But that victory would soon unravel… after five men with ties to the Nixon campaign were arrested for breaking into the Democratic National Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel.**

**The ensuing cover-up and widespread abuse of power would eventually bring down Nixon’s presidency.**

___ARCHIVAL (NIXON LIBRARY, 8-8-74)__:_

_RICHARD NIXON: I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow._

**NARRATION: But right after the break-in, the administration was concerned that campaign contributions had been tied to one of the burglars. John Dean, who was later implicated in the cover up, was White House Counsel.**

JOHN DEAN (WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, 1970-1973, AUTHOR, "THE NIXON DEFENSE"): When Watergate occurs it’s immediately a problem for the White House. It raised the whole issue of what their campaign committee is doing, and the fact that they’ve raised a lot of money.

**NARRATION: Watergate investigators learned that right before a disclosure deadline the Nixon campaign had received tens of millions in confidential donations.**

JOHN DEAN: They had literally stacks and stacks of cash sitting around. They couldn’t count it as fast as it was coming in.

**NARRATION: The source of the money was revealed when a watchdog group, Common Cause, sued the Nixon campaign and discovered a secret White House list of donors, it included corporations, which were legally barred from any political giving.**

FRED WERTHEIMER (COMMON CAUSE 1971-94, DEMOCRACY 21 1994-PRESENT):

That list had the names of all these corporations and the amounts of money they had given. Some people were buying influence, and some people thought that if they didn't put the money up, they would get punished.

___ARCHIVAL (ABC, 7-6-73): _______

_HOWARD K. SMITH: American Airlines has admitted it made illegal corporate contributions to President Nixon’s reelection campaign._

___ARCHIVAL (NBC, 7-6-73):_______

_GARRICK UTLEY: American has charged it was a victim of a shakedown._

___ARCHIVAL (SENATE WATERGATE TESTIMONY 11-15-73):_______

_AMERICAN AIRLINES CEO GEORGE SPATER: There are two aspects: would you get something if you gave it and would you be prevented from getting something if you didn't give it?_

FRED WERTHEIMER: But this money bought results. The President of the United States was exchanging government policy for money.

**NARRATION: After the dairy industry pledged $2 million to his reelection campaign, Nixon approved an increase in the price of milk.**

___ARCHIVAL (NBC, 7-31-1974):_______

_JOHN CHANCELLOR: The former head of the country's biggest dairy cooperative pleaded guilty today._

**NARRATION: The scandals led to the convictions of some of America's biggest corporations… and to an overhaul of the campaign finance system. The law would now limit how much individual_s_ could give to candidates and how much they could spend in elections, while corporate contributions would remain illegal.**

___ARCHIVAL (NBC, 10-15-74):_______

_DOUGLAS KIKER: The federal campaign act of 1974 is going to change American politics forever, and hopefully for the better._

FRED WERTHEIMER: We thought that we got what we needed. I felt we had achieved a very, very historic reform.

**__ACT II:__**

**__ __**

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 10-21-88):_______

_MICHAEL DUKAKIS: Thank you for your generosity._

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 10-21-88): _______

_GEORGE H. W. BUSH: Thank you very, very much._

**NARRATION: But by the 1988 presidential campaign, it was clear there was a major loophole. While donations to candidateswere limited to $1,000, individuals and corporations could give any amount... to political parties.**

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 10-21-88):_______

_DAN RATHER: The campaign handlers like to call it “soft money.”_

___ARCHIVAL: (ABC 9-29-88): _______

_BARRY SERAFIN: Soft money can be raised in any amount._

___ARCHIVAL: (CBS 10-21-88):_______

_BOB FAW: All perfectly legal, the campaigns insist, since they don’t spend the money directly._

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 10-21-88):_______

_ROBERT FARMER: You’ve already done 25,000, so if you could do another 10._

ROBERT FARMER (POLITICAL FUNDRAISER): I’ve always believed that campaign finance reform creates a blueprint for how to game the system.

**NARRATION: Robert Farmer broke fundraising records for Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis… by being the first to capitalize on soft money.**

ROBERT FARMER: It can’t be coordinated with the campaign but it certainly, it’s going to be spent to help the candidate. That's well known.

**NARRATION: Farmer convinced big donors and their friends to become “Trustees,” by asking them to each donate $100,000 dollars to the Democratic Party. It was a strategy his opponents quickly adopted.**

ROBERT FARMER: We took such abuse from the Republicans for this program. That went on for about 45 days and they instituted the exact mirror image of our Trustee Program. Any campaign is a competition. If you don’t have the resources to wage a credible campaign, you’re out of it.

___ARCHIVAL: (PBS FRONTLINE, 10-2-92): _______

_BILL CLINTON: You can’t imagine how important you are to this campaign._

**NARRATION: When president Bill Clinton needed money for his 1996 reelection campaign, he invited supportersandsome of his Party’s biggest soft money donors.**

**For coffee… and sleepovers at the White House.**

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 2-25-97):_______

_DAN RATHER: It's called the Lincoln Bedroom. And while Lincoln never actually slept there, a lot of other people did, including big-money contributors to the Democratic Party_

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 2-25-97):_______

_RITA BRAVER: The president's overnight guests contributed at least $ 7 million dollars to the Democrats._

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 12-16-99):_______

_JOHN MCCAIN: The president of the United States rented out the Lincoln Bedroom, treated it like Motel 6 and he was the bellhop._

**NARRATION: Senator John McCain, who was criticized years earlier for his role in the Keating 5 campaign finance scandal, went on to introduce legislation to close the soft money loophole.**

JOHN MCCAIN (ARIZONA REPUBLICAN): There was too much money that was washing around unattributed and unaccounted for. The system had become corrupted. It took an enormous amount of public pressure to bring about the passage of the legislation.

___ARCHIVAL (NBC 3-20-02):_______

_TOM BROKAW: Tonight, the first significant reform since Watergate is headed to the President’s desk._

**NARRATION: It took seven years , but in 2002, they succeeded.**

___ARCHIVAL (NBC, 9-17-02):_______

_REPORTER: Congress finally cleaned up the system, outlawing huge unlimited contributions from business, labor unions and the wealthy known as soft money._

JOHN MCCAIN: We felt very good. We knew there were going to be challenges, we knew they were out there, but I was very surprised and deeply disappointed when the United States Supreme Court made fundamental decisions such as corporations are the same as people.

**__ACT III:__**

___ARCHIVAL (ABC, 1-21-10):_______

_DIANE SAWYER: A blockbuster decision from the Supreme Court today._

___ARCHIVAL (ABC, 1-21-10):_______

_TERRY MORAN_: _The sharply divided justices declared that the law violates the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech for all, even corporations._

JAMES BOPP (CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWYER): The First Amendment says, “Congress shall make no law abridging speech.” It doesn’t give the right to speak to certain people -- it gives it to everyone.

**NARRATION: James Bopp brought the Citizens United case and says he is bringing more cases so there can be more money -- and more speech - in elections.**

JAMES BOPP: We need a lot more money spent because people are woefully uninformed. Most people can’t even name their congressman.

**NARRATION: The rulings in Citizen's United and other recent cases meant that while there were still limits on giving directly to candidates and parties, individuals and corporations could now give unlimited money … to outside political groups.**

___ARCHIVAL (NBC, 2-7-12):_______

_CHUCK TODD: Nonstop negative TV ads from super PACs, big money groups outside the campaigns._

**NARRATION: While Super PACS have to disclose their donors, other outside groups, known as 501c's, can accept what critics call "dark money..." contributions from donors who don't have to disclose who they are.**

**All these outside groups spent a reported $1 billion dollars in the 2012 election, and are increasingly financed by a small group of big donors from both political parties…**

___ARCHIVAL (ABC News, 4-3-14):_______

_Brian ROSS: Indeed, a handful of billionaires have emerged as the country’s backroom power brokers._

JOHN MCCAIN: If money is free speech, then the wealthiest people in America -- are those that get to speak the most freely.

**NARRATION: And it's not just high-profile, national elections… big outside money is also pouring into state and local contests, even judicial races.**

___ARCHIVAL (YOUTUBE, JUSTICE FOR ALL, HUDSONCHILD MOLESTER AD):_______

_NARRATOR: We want judges to protect us..._

**NARRATION: And funding attack ads like this, which ran during the primary race for the North Carolina Supreme Court.**

___ARCHIVAL (YOUTUBE, JUSTICE FOR ALL, HUDSONCHILD MOLESTER AD):_______

_NARRATOR: Justice Robin Hudson -- not tough on child molesters -- not fair to victims._

ROBIN HUDSON (ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, NORTH CAROLINA SUPREME COURT): I was horrified when I saw it -- the very idea that I or anyone else on the court would quote “side” with child molesters is just completely ridiculous. If they were coming in here spending money to actually educate voters that would be one thing. But that’s not what they’re doing.

**NARRATION: The ad was paid for by "Justice for All NC," a SuperPAC whose address is a P.O. Box at this Raleigh UPS Store. Most of its money comes from The Republican State Leadership Committee, an outside political group based in Washington.**

MATTHEW WALTER (PRESIDENT, REPUBLICAN STATE LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE): We look to find the best return our investment for our dollars in the most effective way, to convey a message to the general public.

**NARRATION: The Committee takes donations from corporations and other outside groups and funnels them into state-level organizations. Those groups then spend that money to influence elections... for judges, legislators and governors.**

MATTHEW WALTER: The money is a means to convey a message about which direction you want the country to go. Anybody that thinks that there should be less money in politics is essentially at odds with the United States Supreme Court that said that this is one of our fundamental freedoms.

JIM BOPP: I think we’re well on the way to see all of the major legal justifications for campaign finance laws to be overturned.

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 4-4-14):_______

_SCOTT PELLEY: Today, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a key limit on political contributions._

LAWRENCE LESSIG: Nobody looks at this political system and likes it. This is overwhelmingly despised by the American public.

**NARRATION: Lawrence Lessig is a Harvard Law professor trying to draw attention to big money in politics by backing candidates who support reform. He's started MAYDAY, a SuperPAC…. to end SuperPACs.**

LAWRENCE LESSIG: The objective is to prove something that the experts don’t believe, and that is that Americans care enough about this issue to vote on the basis of it.

**NARRATION: But Fred Wertheimer worries it's not enough and says today's political landscape looks awfully familiar.**

FRED WERTHEIMER: What was at the core of the Watergate campaign finance scandals? Corporate money, secret money, unlimited contributions from individuals. What do we have today? Corporate money, secret money, unlimited contributions from individuals.

JOHN MCCAIN: We are full circle to the days prior to Watergate. There are not people walking around the streets of Washington, DC with briefcases full of money, but we are very close to that.
