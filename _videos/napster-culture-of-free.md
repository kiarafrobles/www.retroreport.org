The software was called Napster, so named by its 18-year-old developer, and its usage soon exploded on college campuses across the country. No longer did music lovers have to go to the record store to buy CDs -- with the click of a mouse, they could gain free access to their favorite tunes.

But a generation of consumers had tasted a new way to get what they wanted -- today's music industry, and the musicians themselves, are still grappling with the Culture of Free.
