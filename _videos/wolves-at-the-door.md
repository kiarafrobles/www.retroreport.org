Some call it one of the great conservation success stories of our time. After being nearly killed off, gray wolves were re-introduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995.

Since then, the population has bounced back to more than 1,600 across the northern Rocky Mountains. But some say a protracted fight over whether the wolves remain endangered has had some unintended consequences.
