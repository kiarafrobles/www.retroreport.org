On Nov. 13, 1982, boxing fans tuned in for a championship bout on national television between Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini of Ohio and South Korean fighter Duk-Koo Kim. It was an epic, 14-round slugfest -- and a fight the sport wouldn't soon forget. Afterward, medical concerns about the brutality of boxing mounted, and the sport's foothold in mainstream American culture began to slip. Today, stories about brain injuries in football are making headlines with increasingly regularity. Is the most popular sport in America nearing its own inflection point?
