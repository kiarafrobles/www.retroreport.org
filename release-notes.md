- improved the blurring algorythym for video background images to look slightly more like the image itself.
- improved list handling (...and, and serial commas)

performance improvements:
 - serve all images from a CDN

todo:
 - Include Reports on video page
 - improve youtube video loading jank/time
 - review images from imigix and see if we can improve speed with quality/size, etc.
 - if there are more than one mini-docs related to a video, each mini-doc page should show them all. (this might just be a related video function)
