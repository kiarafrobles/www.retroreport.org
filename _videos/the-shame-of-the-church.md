In 2002, revelations of widespread sexual abuse led the U.S. bishops to pass a set of landmark reforms to end abuse in the Church. But as new scandals and long-secret files continue to come to light, even the Archbishop who presided over those new policies says the crisis seems like “a never-ending drama."

Survivors, like Barbara Blaine, who have led the charge for serious reform, claim a basic issue is still not being addressed: holding bishops accountable for protecting sexually-abusive priests.
