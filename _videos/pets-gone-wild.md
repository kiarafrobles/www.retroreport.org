<span class="s1">For more than a decade, Burmese pythons have been multiplying unchecked in the wilds of Florida, and thwarting repeated attempts by state environmental officials to get the invasive population under control.</span>

<span class="s1">It's not easy. The snakes – some as long as 16 feet – were originally imported from Asia, and face few natural predators in the Everglades. They are non-venomous, strangle their prey, then eat it whole. They prey on anything and everything from rabbits to foxes to deer – even alligators devastating local wildlife populations and spooking visitors.</span>

<span class="s1">After years of debate, and over protests of the reptile industry, which feared any restrictions on their trade, the federal government in 2012 finally banned the import of Burmese pythons – and ultimately seven other giant snakes.</span>

Pythons are not the only invasive species on scientists' radar. Non-native lizards, fish, frogs, hogs and zebra mussels - to name just a few - are threatening U.S. lands and waterways.
