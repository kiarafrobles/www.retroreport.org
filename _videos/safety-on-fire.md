description: "There are over 80,000 chemicals in use today. The story of TRIS, removed from children's pajamas in the 1970s, illustrates just how hard it is to regulate chemicals, or to even know if they're safe. "
tweet: "What do we know about the flame retardants in our everyday products? Not as much as you'd hope."

In 1977, the flame retardant TRIS was removed from children's pajamas as a suspected carcinogen, but it continued to be used in a host of other products—including baby cribs, car seats, and furniture.

Since then, scientists have discovered that flame retardants can leach out of products into household dust, collect in our bodies, and pose health risks, especially to developing babies.

But no flame retardant has been banned by the federal government, and there are no specific tests required before a new chemical is put on the market. And with 80,000 untested chemicals out there, that raises a question: how do we know what's safe?
