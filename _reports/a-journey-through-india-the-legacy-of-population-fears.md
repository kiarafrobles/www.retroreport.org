By 2030, India is poised to become the most populous nation in the world. The country's fertility rate has declined from an estimated 5.9 children per woman in the 1950s to 2.5 today. But concern about population persists in this country of 1.2 billion people, particularly in northern India where women on average are still having more children.

<span class="s1">A state in northern India, Bihar has lagged in development. Literacy rates are among the lowest in India, while infant and maternal mortality rates are higher, and health infrastructure is less developed.</span>

<span class="s1">India has the world's largest youth population - measured as those between ages 10 and 24\. Health advocates say that in order to better address the needs of such a large young population, there needs to be greater investment in a wide range of birth control options.</span>

<span class="s1">The state remains primarily rural. Fertility can be higher in rural and more impoverished areas; traditionally more children meant more hands to help out with farming.</span>

<span class="s1">Literacy rates are lower in Bihar than in any other state in India, according to 2011 Indian Census data. Experts draw a connection between level of schooling and high fertility. “Look at what education does to people's lives,” says Subha Sri, a doctor in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. “When you're literate,” she says, “you are automatically exposed to a lot more information.” She continues: “And I think that plays a role in actually deciding how many children you want, at what age you want them.”</span>

<span class="s1">Ashas help women, particularly those in rural areas, navigate the public health system. As a part of state incentive systems—which pay patients, doctors, and health care workers for every sterilization—ashas, some argue, may be influenced to push sterilization. In certain regions that's still the only birth control option made available, despite the fact that the Indian government has promised to expand access to other methods of contraception.</span>

**Surrounded by family members, women rest shortly after having sterilization operations at the Cheria Bariarpur Primary Health Centre in the Begusarai District of Bihar.**

<span class="s1">According to the most recent National Family Health Survey (2005-2006), seventy-seven percent of sterilized women in India had never used any other method of birth control before sterilization.</span>

**Women undergo sterilization operations at the Cheria Bariarpur Primary Health Centre. A few dozen women were sterilized that day at the centre.**

<span class="s1">Although India officially abandoned sterilization targets years ago, unofficial targets remain in place, according to people working on the ground. One Primary Health Centre doctor says the targets in themselves are not necessarily the problem, arguing instead that it's the lack of a good healthcare infrastructure in some places that makes it difficult to safely meet those targets.</span>

<span class="s1">Many health care workers point out that sterilization is a one-time procedure that requires little follow-up care, and for rural women without regular access to health services and less autonomy in their decision making, it can often be the best tool they have to control their own fertility.</span>

<span class="s1">Sonia had undergone a sterilization operation a few days earlier. After she gave birth to Lovely, her fourth child, she says an asha told her about the option of using sterilization to limit her family size. Sonia didn't appear to be aware of other methods of birth control.</span>

“The poorest people are having the largest families, and there are reasons for it,” says Dr. Shakeel ur Rahman, who runs a non-governmental organization in Patna. Providing contraceptive services alone does not attack the root causes of high fertility, he says; rather the approach needs to be more nuanced.

<span class="s1">“If you want to move the needle on population control, this is the epicenter,” Don Douglas, Director of Patna's Janani Surya Clinic says about the region. In recent years Bihar has started offering monetary incentives to encourage women to give birth in hospitals instead of at home.</span>

<span class="s1">A patient of Patna's Janani Surya Clinic, Seema Devi chose to limit her family to three children. After using a Copper-T IUD for years, she opted for the more permanent option of sterilization. She said it would be difficult for her and her husband to support another child, and to provide their three children with the kind of education they want for them.</span>

Literacy rates are much higher in the state of Tamil Nadu and across southern India in general, and fertility rates are lower. Tamil Nadu has had a robust history of social welfare programs, such as the midday meal program, which provides free lunches to schoolchildren. Now a nationwide program, it was first introduced in Tamil Nadu and has been particularly effective there in improving both attendance and childhood nutrition.

<span class="s1">A recent state program targeting maternal health has increased the amount of money provided to mothers below the poverty line. Payments are made in three installments: following completion of an array of tests and a sonogram during her pregnancy, following birth in a government facility, and, several months later, following the baby's first immunizations.</span>

<span class="s1">Dr. Subha Sri, of Tamil Nadu, says that when looking at broader questions about population and fertility rates, one needs to think beyond the availability of family planning services. “People have to make a choice to actually use those services, and people will make that choice if...they see how it's actually going to change their lives.” But sometimes the more powerful predictor of family size is tradition. Dr. Shakeel ur Rahman, of Patna, says that in impoverished and often rural areas, children—and boys specifically—are seen as a form of social security: families “want a male child, and unless there is a male child, the girl children will be produced again and again and again.”</span>
