In 1980, four American churchwomen, working as missionaries, were raped and then murdered in El Salvador. The killings created a storm of protest in the United States, revealed the brutality of the civil war in El Salvador and raised awareness about America's policies in Central America. Now, the families of the slain churchwomen are still hoping to find justice — this time in American immigration courts.

Traveling at night to avoid detection by Salvadoran troops, leftist guerillas eventually brought them to a small village — El Mozote — and to an unspeakable crime.
