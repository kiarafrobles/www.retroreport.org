Dungeons & Dragons debuted in 1974 and had moved from a cult classic to a mainstream hit by the early 1980s. Millions of kids around the world were gathering around tables and going on imaginary adventures set by the Dungeon Master as part of this role playing game. But a string of murder-suicides that involved kids who played the game brought a new focus, and critics, many of them conservative Christians, thought the game was an invitation to devil worship and violence.

Today, the game is still a popular pastime and instead of it triggering a moral panic, itâ€™s considered by many parents and sociologists to be the kind of activity that encourages kids to gather in real time, and use their imagination. In short, proponents say that D&D playing is the kind of activity that encourages positive social engagement and a preferable alternative to screen time.
