_Oh, please don’t say that._

_Escopiando? Escopiando?_

**__ACT I:__**

LARRY MULLOY (NASA, 1960-1986): Up until the Challenger Accident, NASA was a very untypical government agency. We were inventing as we went along, so we had a lot of freedom.

DIANE VAUGHAN (AUTHOR, THE CHALLENGER LAUNCH DECISION): It was viewed internationally as a fantastic place. The Apollo missions gave it an aura of invincibility. We were taken as the international leader in the space race. And no one was really expecting anything to go wrong.

ALLAN MCDONALD (MORTON-THIOKOL, 1959-2001): The Apollo program over the years that it actually operated had very few launches.But NASA had some very ambitious plans.

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 4-12-81): ___

_ANCHOR: Four 4 minutes and 27 seconds to go before the start of this historic mission._

**NARRATION: The year was 1981 and NASA was about to amaze the world with Columbia, a new spacecraft that pushed the limits of imagination.**

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 4-12-81): ___

_ANCHOR: They never before have sent a spacecraft into orbit that is going to come down as a plane …_

**NARRATION: Instead of using a single rocket, like Apollo, the shuttle was attached to an external fuel tank and two solid-rocket boosters. Each of the boosters was constructed of joined metal tubes, and the field joints were sealed with two rubber gaskets, called “O-rings.”**

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 4-12-81):___

_ANCHOR: Look at those huge engines getting ready to catapult this really strange assemblage off the Earth._

**NARRATION: But all this technology wasn’t cheap, and NASA had to come up with a new funding model.**

DIANE VAUGHAN: The creation of the whole shuttle program came in a different economic era than the Apollo program.

**NARRATION: So Congress and NASA decided the shuttle program could pay its way by carrying payloads into orbit.**

DIANE VAUGHAN: The Department of Defense, private contractors that wanted experiments done in space, would pay them to take them up on the shuttle.

ALLAN MCDONALD: It was going to be a real routine expressway to space.

**NARRATION: And unlike Apollo, the shuttle system was going to be almost entirely reusable.**

ALLAN MCDONALD: They had to return this hardware back into space as rapidly as they could. It wasn’t long into the program they realized that that process was far more difficult than they ever anticipated.

DIANE VAUGHAN: They were under constant pressure to launch.

___ARCHIVAL (CBS, 4-12-81):_______

_COLUMBIA MISSION CONTROL: T-minus 10, 9, 8_

_COMMENTATOR: I’m getting a few butterflies myself, right now._

_ANCHOR: Sure._

_COLUMBIA MISSION CONTROL: We’ve gone for main engine start … we have main engine start._

_COMMENTATOR: C’mon baby! C’mon baby!_

_COLUMBIA MISSION CONTROL: And we’ve launched America’s first space shuttle!_

_COMMENTATOR: Go, baby, go! Fly like an eagle!_

**NARRATION: Columbia was a fantastic success, but NASA had to figure out how to make these technological feats routine.**

DIANE VAUGHAN: They predicted in the beginning that they would be able to launch 60 shuttles a year. That NASA would in fact become self-paying, or self-funded.

LARRY MULLOY: We had two pads up and running, so you had two vehicles out on the pad. And they were going to launch like three days apart.

DIANE VAUGHAN: But that really never happened. It was an experimental technology, and they just couldn’t manage that many, so they continually fell behind.

**NARRATION: The shuttle program never had more than nine launches in a single year.**

___ARCHIVAL: (NASA, MISSION CONTROL 8-30-84): ___

_We have a beautiful picture now._

**NARRATION: And to help meet their ambitious schedules, NASA worked with private contractors to build many of the shuttle’s systems, while NASA engineers analyzed data to see how well everything performed.**

ALLAN MCDONALD: NASA kept very good records of anomalies -- the problem is that they ran into a lot of these.

**NARRATION: One thing engineers saw was the O-rings that sealed the booster joints weren’t behaving according to design. On several flights, especially those at cold temperatures, rocket propellant had blown by the primary O-ring.**

DIANE VAUGHAN: The first time it happened, they accepted it. They tested it. They thought they knew what had happened. And then the next launch, everything worked. And then a few more launches and it happened again.

**NARRATION: But each time the secondary O-ring prevented gasses from escaping the side of the booster. So rather than stalling the program to redesign the joint, NASA waived the requirements governing O-rings, which effectively made it acceptable to fly with minimal erosion.**

VAUGHAN: Even with the worst O-ring erosion they’d ever had, it hadn’t failed, so, they started to work on it, but they really weren’t rushing. It didn’t seem so terrible. But they continually expanded the bounds of acceptable risk.

**NARRATION: And then came the tenth Challenger launch -- and a mission unlike any NASA had attempted before.**

ALLAN MCDONALD: They decided to make that the first flight that a ordinary citizen could fly -- and that drew a tremendous interest from the public, plus the school systems were going to show this live on television.

___ARCHIVAL (NASA CHALLENGER PRELAUNCH PRESS CONFERENCE):___

_NASA ASTRONAUT: At this time I’d like to introduce you to perhaps the person you came to see, and that’s Christa McCaulliffe, our payload specialist, Teacher in Space._

ALLAN MCDONALD: My job at the time of the Challenger was the director of the space shuttle solid rocket motor project for my company, Morton Thiokol.

**NARRATION: Morton Thiokol was an engineering firm out of Brigham City, Utah and had the NASA contract to build the shuttle boosters.**

___ARCHIVAL (NASA CHALLENGER PRELAUNCH PRESS CONFERENCE):___

_CHRISTA MCCAULLIFFE: Well, I am so excited to be here, and I just hope everyone tunes in on day four now to watch the teacher teaching from space._

DIANE VAUGHAN: On the day before Challenger, there was an overnight low that was record-breaking.

ALLAN MCDONALD: I got a telephone call from one of the program managers back in Utah that worked for me. And he says, “Al, we just heard that it might get down to as low as 18 degrees by tomorrow morning.” “Good grief,” I said, “I’m really worried about these O-ring seals being able to operate properly at those kinds of temperatures.”

**NARRATION: The mission had already been rescheduled after routine delays. So now, Morton Thiokol and NASA scheduled an emergency teleconference the night before the launch.**

DIANE VAUGHAN: The engineers at Thiokol were very concerned. So they began scrambling to put together an analysis of temperature data.

**NARRATION: Larry Mulloy was NASA’s project manager for the solid rocket boosters.**

LARRY MULLOY (NASA PROJECT MANAGER): We went out to the teleconference, and uh, Roger Boisjoly who was kind of the O-ring czar at Morton Thiokol did most of the talking. The recommendation was is that we wait until it is 54 degrees before we launch.So I said something like, “54 degrees where?”

DIANE VAUGHAN: They had never drawn a temperature line before. And it meant a tremendous change to the shuttle’s schedule.

ALLAN MCDONALD: It isn’t what they wanted to hear. In fact, Larry made a comment, “Thiokol, when the hell do you want me to launch, next April?”

**NARRATION: Thiokol’s engineers in Utah were caught off guard by NASA’s strong reaction to their recommendation, so they asked if they could have some time off the teleconference to review the data in private.**

LARRY MULLOY: After they went offline Al McDonald was visibly upset. And he said, I wouldn’t want to be the guy that had to appear at a board of inquiry if this thing blows. And I said, “I understand that, Al, and you won’t have to. That’ll be me.“

DIANE VAUGHAN: At Thiokol the vice president was asking those engineers to stand up for what they said. Roger Boisjoly took the lead in the objections. He said, “I can’t prove it to you. All I know is that it’s away from goodness in our experience base.” But the engineers at Thiokol didn’t have the data. So the vice president took the decision-making away from the engineers and asked the managers to decide.

**NARRATION: And they did. More than 30 minutes after the engineers had gone offline, Thiokol managers voted to reverse the recommendation and to launch the Challenger as planned. The teleconference became a focal point for the White House appointed Rogers Commission that investigated NASA after the disaster.**

___ARCHIVAL (ROGERS COMMISSION):___

_ROGER BOISJOLY: There was not one positive statement for launch ever made in that room._

___ARCHIVAL (ROGERS COMMISSION): ___

_DONALD KUTNYA: What was driving you here? What was going to be achieved that caused you to go?_

ALLAN MCDONALD: NASA pressured the folks at Thiokol to change their mind. And it was clear to me that we finally came back and gave them what they wanted to hear.

LARRY MULLOY: You know, we’d been rationalizing this erosion since the second flight.

DIANE VAUGHAN: None of the information the NASA managers were getting was new. This was not individuals getting used to something. This was organizationally supported.

LARRY MULLOY: That’s where the accident was inevitable.

**NARRATION: Once Thiokol reversed their initial recommendation, someone needed to sign off on the launch rationale.**

ALLAN MCDONALD: I did the smartest thing I ever did in my lifetime. I refused to sign it. I just felt it was too much risk to take.

**NARRATION: So just before midnight, McDonald’s boss, Joe Kilminster, signed off instead. After the disaster, the commission concluded cold and joint design were major factors in Challenger’s O-ring failure. It also squarely pointed a finger at NASA managers like Mulloy.**

DIANE VAUGHAN: The Commission did recognize that there was pressure to launch. But they saw it as enacted by amorally calculating managers who were in positions of responsibility. I found something completely different.

**NARRATION: So Vaughan began her own investigation.**

DIANE VAUGHAN:No one wanted this to happen. But intuition, you know, I don’t feel good about this, should have been OK. And they applied all the usual rules in a situation where the usual rules didn’t apply.

___ARCHIVAL (NASA, MISSION CONTROL 1-28-86): _______

_4-3-2-1._

LARRY MULLOY: We made a grievous error.

DIANE VAUGHAN: So the real crux of the matter is, how do you get people to recognize when you need to do something different than what you’d been trained to do?

**__ACT II:__**

**NARRATION: After Challenger, the Rogers Commission prompted many changes at NASA, including an increase in the program’s budget, adding a third O-ring to the booster joints and moving some managers, including Mulloy, out of the shuttle program.**

DIANE VAUGHAN: But there was nothing really about how to change the organization that came out of the commission report.

___ARCHIVAL (DISCOVERY WAKE-UP CALL, 9-30-11): ___

_ROBIN WILLIAMS: Good Morning, Discovery! Rise and shine, boys!_

**NARRATION: It took two years for NASA to launch another shuttle, but once it was away, the program had 15 years of successful missions.**

___ARCHIVAL (DISCOVERY WAKE-UP CALL, 9-30-11): ___

_GREEN ACRES TUNE: Free-wheeling on Dis-cov-ery!_

**NARRATION: And then in 2003, came the 28<sup>th</sup> Columbia launch. The space shuttle that started all.**

RODNEY ROCHA (NASA ENGINEER, 1974-PRESENT): It seemed like any other launch. But on the second day someone called me on the phone and said, “You’ve heard about the large piece of debris, or foam, that came off the tank and hit the left wing? Caused a cloud -- a poof. I said, “No, I didn’t.”

**NARRATION: Columbia made it into orbit safely, but the concern was that if debris had caused damage to the left wing, the point of impact could be vulnerable to extreme heat and turbulence on re-entry. So just days after the launch, NASA formed a special team to asses the damage.**

RODNEY ROCHA: We’re supposed to have this analysis all wrapped up in three days. But we didn’t know exactly where it hit. We needed a photo, an image, that definitely says, here’s where it hit, and here’s the damage.

**NARRATION: And the best visuals the team had to work with were a few grainy photos captured at launch.**

RODNEY ROCHA: The decision to ask for more data, the need for it, was unanimous.

**NARRATION: But smaller foam and other debris had fallen from shuttles before without catastrophe. And since Columbia was already in orbit, getting better imagery meant NASA must do it from space -- most likely by taking shots of the shuttle’s underside from a nearby satellite.**

RODNEY ROCHA: The next day, I get an email saying, “The answer is no.” I called up the chief engineer and said, “Why don’t you back this up?” And he said, “Well, I don’t want to be a Chicken Little about this.” And I was stunned by that response, and I said, “Chicken Little? The program is acting like an ostrich with its head in the sand!”

**NARRATION: Management was worried about unnecessarily diverting Columbia from its mission, since foam damage had been generally considered to be a non-threatening maintenance concern. Linda Ham, the chair of the management team, finally put the issue to rest on teleconference eight days into the mission, while Columbia’s crew orbited above.**

___ARCHIVAL (MISSION MANAGEMENT TELECON, 1-24-03):___

_DON NOAH: We could lose an entire tile. It could be a significant area of tile damage._

___ARCHIVAL (MISSION MANAGEMENT TELECON, 1-24-03):___

_LINDA HAM: We were just re-iterating, with Calvin, that he doesn’t believe there is any burn through, so no safety of flight issue, it’s more of a turnaround issue, similar to what we’ve had on other flights. All right. Any questions on that?_

**NARRATION: In the end, Ham received three requests for imaging from different parts of NASA.**

DIANE VAUGHAN: And they were all put down for different reasons. The similarity between Challenger and Columbia was the falling back on routine under uncertain circumstances.

**NARRATION: The day before the teleconference, NASA sent their only communication to the Columbia astronauts about the debris strike. And on February 1, 2003 the crew began their return to Earth.**

___ARCHIVAL (NASA, MISSION CONTROL, 2-1-03):___

_COLUMBIA ASTRONAUT: K.C., can you look at the camera for a second? Look at me. There. (laughs)_

RODNEY ROCHA: Part of our engineering culture is that you should work through your chain of command. I will regret, always, why I didn’t break the door down by myself.

___ARCHIVAL (NASA, MISSION CONTROL, 2-1-03):___

_And we’re ready, Willy. No Deltas._

_Everything look good to you?_

_I don’t see anything out of the ordinary._

___ARCHIVAL (NASA, MISSION CONTROL, 2-1-03):___

_This is amazing. It’s really getting … it’s really bright out there._

RODNEY ROCHA: They had just started the de-orbit burn, they’re coming down, and, um, we started seeing temperatures change higher on the left side versus the right.

___ARCHIVAL (NASA, MISSION CONTROL, 2-1-03):___

_FYI, I’ve just lost four separate temperature transducers on the left side of the vehicle._

RODNEY ROCHA: The anomalous data confirmed my worst fear.

___ARCHIVAL (NASA, MISSION CONTROL, 2-1-03):___

Columbia Houston, UHF com check. Columbia Houston, UHF com check.

RODNEY ROCHA: I looked up and I saw one of our chief engineers in tears. “We can’t get the crew,” she said. “They’ve been incommunicado.” It happened. It happened.

**NARRATION: Columbia was destroyed on re-entry.**

**After the disaster, Vaughan worked closely with the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, which concluded that NASA had inefective leadership and a flawed safety culture.**

___ARCHIVAL (8-26-14):___

_HAROLD GEHMAN: We are quite convinced that these organizational matters are just as important as the foam._

**__ACT III:__**

**NARRATION: Ham soon left the shuttle program, and Vaughan’s insights into organizational decision-making, have proven relevant far beyond the walls of NASA.**

DIANE VAUGAN: This happens in many different kinds of organizations. I don’t think the general public got the position of either Larry Mulloy or Linda Ham, and that their behavior was to a great deal determined by working in a very rule-oriented organization.

**NARRATION: After Columbia, NASA restructured the shuttle program’s management team, and required an inspection of the orbiter’s underbelly on all trips to the International Space Station.**

**All told, NASA had 133 successful shuttle missions apart from the Challenger and Columbia tragedies. But in its more than 30 years of operation, the program was never able to cover costs. And in 2011, it all came to an end when Atlantis touched down at Kennedy Space Center and NASA fully turned its attentions to smaller, unmanned spacecraft. Today, NASA pays the Russian Space Agency to carry American astronauts into space.**

DIANE VAUGAN: We can never resolve the problem of complexity, but you have to be sensitive to your organization and how it works. While a lot of us work in complex organizations, we don’t really realize the way that the organizations we inhabit, completely inhabit us.
